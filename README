This directory contains the files you will need for the CS:APP Proxy
Lab.

proxy.c
csapp.h
csapp.c
cache.h
cache.c
    These are starter files.  csapp.c and csapp.h are described in
    your textbook. 

    You should only modify cache.c files and proxy.c files for this project.
    Do not modify any other files or add more files to this projecct.

libcache.a
    This is a static library that contains the solution of 4 cache functions
    you should implement for cache.c. It is used to make the ./proxy executable
    that you can run.

    While the executable ./proxycache is compiled using cache.c (your implementation).

    Please use `port-for-user.pl' or 'free-port.sh' to generate
    unique ports for your proxy or tiny server. 

Makefile
    This is the makefile that builds the proxy program.  Type "make"
    to build your solution, or "make clean" followed by "make" for a
    fresh build. 

port-for-user.pl
    Generates a random port for a particular user
    usage: ./port-for-user.pl <userID>

free-port.sh
    Handy script that identifies an unused TCP port that you can use
    for your proxy or tiny. 
    usage: ./free-port.sh

driver.sh
    The autograder for Basic, and Cache.        
    usage: ./driver.sh

nop-server.py
     helper for the autograder.         

tiny
    Tiny Web server from the CS:APP text
